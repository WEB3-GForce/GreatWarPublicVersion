=begin
	The MotionSystem defines several useful methods for handling the
	movement of entities upon a board. In particular, it is capable of:
	
		- Determining which tiles an entity can move to
		- Determining a path from one tile to another
		- Moving an entity from one tile to another
	
	Any JSON movement-related requests from the frontend should be directed
	to this system
