This file provides general documentation on the format of attack systems and
how to create new ones.

In general, the attack system consists of three main tiers:

	1. Higher Level Systems
	2. DamageSystem
	3. KillSystem
	
Let's examine each in turn starting at the bottom and moving to the top:

3. KillSystem

	The KillSystem is simply responsible for checking if entities are alive
	and removing dead entities from the game (entity_manager, board, etc).

2. DamageSystem

	The DamageSystem is responsible for applying damage to entities. It
	is simply given the entity and the damage to apply. It does not care
	how the damage was determined but simply applies it. It then calls
	the KillSystem to see if the entity needs to be removed.
	
1. Higher Level Systems

	In short, higher level systems are responsible for calculating the damage
	to an entity to be passed to the DamageSystem.
	
	For example, the MeleeSystem is such a system. It performs
	checks to make sure that the entities involved can actually attack
	each other. Then, it retrieves the MeleeAttackComponent of the attacker
	and then sends (attacked_entity, damage) to the DamageSystem for it to
	apply the damage. Lastly, it makes the attacked entity retaliate if it
	can attack and is still alive.
	
	In short, the higher level systems handle the semantics of the attacks
	and use the lower level systems to actually apply the damage.


Each system also returns an array describing the result. This is done to make
sending data to the frontend easier. In short, the array returned should be
of the following form:

	[[information_about_result], [more_info], [more_info]]
	
This will make it easier to send messages to the frontend. One would simply need
to go through each array, transform it into a message, and send it off.

All systems return [] if an invalid argument is given or nothing occurs.

On that note, let's look at how each return result is formatted:


3. KillSystem

	At the moment, the system returns a result of the following:
	
		[["kill", entity_id, whether_entity_was_removed_from_board, owner_if_it_has_one]]
		
	For example:
	
		[["kill", "entity#0", true, "entity#21"]]
		

2. DamageSystem

	The basic return result is:
	
		[[entity_damaged, entity_damaged_row, entity_damaged_col, damage_amount]] 
		
	For example:
	
		[["entity#1", 0, 1, 10]]
	
	If the entity also dies, it will return
	
		[[entity_damaged, entity_damaged_row, entity_damaged_col, damage_amount], [kill_info]]
		
	For example:
	
		[["entity#0", 0, 1, 10], ["kill", "entity#0", true, "entity#21"]]
		

3. Higher Level System

	Higher level systems will basically be lists of DamageSystem/KillSystem
	records.
	
	There is one important note that needs to be made. The frontend needs to
	know what type of attack caused damage. Hence, it is the responsibility
	for the higher level system to include this.
	
	For example, this result from the DamageSystem:
	
		[["entity#1", 0, 1, 10]]
		
	would be transformed into this for the MeleeSystem:
	
		[["melee", "attacking_entity", "entity#1", 0, 1, 10]]
	
	Each higher level attack system should add its result. The easiest way
	to do this programatically is:
	
		(result[0].unshift attacking_entity).unshift type_of_attack if !result.empty?

	where result is the return result of the DamageSystem.


As for two final tips:

	1. Always return one's results as an array of arrays:
	
		[[thing_one], [thing_two], [thing_three], ...]
		
	2. array.concat is your friend
	
		[[thing_one]].concat [[thing_two]] => [[thing_one], [thing_two]]
		
		[[thing_one]].concat [] => [[thing_one]]
		
	Hence, there is no need to have special cases for empty arrays.
