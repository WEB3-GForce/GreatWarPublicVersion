=begin
	The HealthComponent is used for entities that have hit points and can
	sustain damage. The component keeps track of the current and maximum
	health of the entity and can determine whether the entity is alive.
	
	For example, a unit such as an infantry piece would have a
	HealthComponent, which would keep track of the amount of damage it has
	taken thus far. When its health reaches 0, it would be removed from the
	game.
