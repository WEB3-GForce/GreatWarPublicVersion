=begin
	The EntityManager is the "database table" of the ecs model. It is
	responsible for mapping entities (rows) to their components (columns).
	The manager provides a quick, efficient way to determine which
	components belong to an entity. It often provides hashes to make it
	fast to determine which entities have a given component.
	
	The EntityManager contains all the game state data for the game. Hence,
	a game can be saved and loaded by marshalling/ unmarshalling the
	EntityManager.
