I have gone through the component and entity folders and done some clean-up of
the code. Namely:

   1) I added comments to the files elaborating on the classes overall and their
   methods.
   
   2) Corrected the names and methods of the files to be snake_case as this is
   preferred in Ruby.
   
   3) Added tests under the spec folder (at the top directory of the project) for
   each class and tested each method

I have gone through all the files that are snake_cased. Those that are still
camelCased have not yet been revised.

Please ask me (web25) if you have any questions about the code.

IMPORTANT PLEASE READ: If you change any files, please update the tests under
 spec to properly reflect and test these changes.
